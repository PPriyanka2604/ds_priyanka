## 🔍 Key Insights from EDA

- **PnL is higher** on 'Greed' days → Traders perform better in bullish conditions.
- **Larger trade sizes** are observed during 'Greed' → Reflects confidence or risk appetite.
- **Fee increases** with trade size → Impacts profitability but reflects aggressive strategy.
- **Weak correlation** between size and PnL → Smart strategy matters more than volume.
